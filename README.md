# crowdfunding_ETL PROJECT 2

#For this Extract, Transform and Load mini project, we worked to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database. Below is the final ERD for the project:
